# Weather Dashboard

In this assignment the goal was to creat a weather dashboard that pulls the current and future weather data of a city when searched

The user is able to type in the name of any city in the world and will be presented with the option to choose between the city's current or future weather conditions 

If the user picks the current then they will see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.

if they click on the future then they should see a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity



WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
